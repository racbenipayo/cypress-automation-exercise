Automation exercise using Cypress

Hi! This is the work I have done for the Automation Exercise you have given me

I worked on all 4 items, as I took it as a great learning opportunity for automation using Cypress. I initially wanted to do Robot Framework, but I have decided that it is easier to learn Cypress than to learn how to integrate Robot Framework with Cypress.

The exercises can be found on cypress > cypress > e2e > exercise, where it is separated by feature.

In login and signup, you will see that there are files written in test case format, and there are files with -DDT and -designpattern attached to the feature. I wanted to document how I have written the code as I was just starting to learn and the how I have written the code upon learning the concept of data-driven testing and design patterns.

Thank you for giving me this opportunity, I had so much fun working on this and learning along the way.
